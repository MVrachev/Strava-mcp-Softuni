# Strava MCP example

This repository was created as part of the presentation about:
`Making LLMs Smarter: Meet Model Context Protocol` as SoftUni at Bulgaria
happening on 21-st of April 2025.

This repository is created for a Bulgarian audience, but if you can
translate the instructions in the [instructions](instructions.md) file,
then you can run Strava MCP server on your own!
